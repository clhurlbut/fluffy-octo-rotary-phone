# Code Refactor Starter Code

I tried to clone the code into a new repository but it just cloned the whole repository. I figured out a work around and made a new repository with the cloned code in there, but I want to spend some time going over how to clone code into a new repository.

After finally getting my own repository so I can push commits, I read through both the code and the stylesheet and took notes of some things I thought could change, like the ordering of H3 and H2 in the stylesheet, and the over use of different class when it could be simplified into one. 

I simplified the stylesheet and arranged it in the way I would think would be appropriate, following the order of the index.html. I am not sure I got the naming all correct, but I wanted to try to guess what would be appropriate. 

I fixed the links so they go to the appropriate place. I made sure the title was correct and appropriate and that the imgs all had alt titles. 

I am wondering if I should be trying to add more search engine optimization - I might take a moment and research to see if I should be adding additional tags somewhere for google. I remember briefly reading it in the module earlier. 

I have now realized that in order for the website to properly deploy I have to remove the files from the Develop folder. Will do this later!
